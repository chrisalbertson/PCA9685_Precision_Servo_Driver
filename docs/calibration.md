# How To Install Servos
### Overview
First we asemble the servo and the parts they move to an
approximate level of accuracy, then we use software for a
fine level of calibration.  Exact assembly is not possible
because the drive spline has only 24 teeth and we can at
best only assemble to the closest tooth but in practice
we might misjudge by one tooth.

### Move Servo to midpoint.
Use a serv tester or some compuer oftware to move the servo to
its mid point.  
This is usually 1500 micro seconds and 90 degrees.
Then, disconnect the servo's cable and be careful not to 
rotate the servo's output shaft.
### Assemble the servo into the robot.
Assemble the parts and the servo so that the robot's parts
are at their mid point of movement.  
Get this as close as you can "by eyeball".
### Calibrate the servo as installed.
Use a servo tester or computer software to move the robot part
to it's exact 
mid-point and write down the pulse with (in micro seconds) 
needed to get perfect alignment.
### Define the movement range limits
Using the servo tester or computer software move the robot part
to the lowest microsecond setting that corresponds to the limit
of where you want to part to move.
Usually this is just before hitting a mechanical stop.
Do the same for the upper limit of movement.
### Measure the angles.
This measurement provide a double check on the above.  
Using a protractor, measure the angles for 
the lower limit, mid-point and upper limit.
You might want to place protractor so the midpoint is at
the 90 degree mark.  But it does not matter.  
Just record the three numbers.
